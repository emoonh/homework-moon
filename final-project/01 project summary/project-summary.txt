Project Summary

The web application planned for in this project will be a tool that serves as a task manager and organizer the user can customize depending on their need. Key features include visual interactivity, simplicity, and ease-of-use for people who enjoy lists of things to complete on a day to day basis. 
It includes the ability of rearranging blocks of information (inputted text or image) in the desired order as well  as delivering that same information in a simple and visual interface when activated. By scrolling up and down the page, the blocks will appear in the same order they were organized in. There will be options where the user can hide the block of information by tapping/clicking a button or 'completing' it and having its background turn grey. This application is intended to be available for both desktop and mobile devices. 
An example of this is an (optionally)ordered list of groceries, where the user can scroll up/down to browse their items. Every block of information occupies the space of the screen and smoothly transitions into the next block; one block at a time is displayed. The same desabling buttons mentioned above will be available for the user.
